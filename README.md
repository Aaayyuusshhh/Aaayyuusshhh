🔥 What I’m About
I am deeply interested in the fields of **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science**, with a strong focus on how these technologies can be applied to solve practical challenges.  

My academic and professional journey has given me exposure to:  
- 📊 **Data Science & Analytics** – working with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling  
- 🤖 **AI/ML Development** – building and deploying models using frameworks like PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Transformers  
- 🌐 **Software & Web Development** – developing scalable applications using React, Node.js, and modern web technologies  
- 🏗️ **Systems & Networks** – experience in wireless operations, connectivity planning, and system optimization  
- 📚 **Research & Innovation** – co-authoring and publishing research in applied machine learning for healthcare  

I aim to combine these interests to design **intelligent, reliable, and impactful solutions** that bridge the gap between research and real-world application.
